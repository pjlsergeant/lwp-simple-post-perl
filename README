NAME
    LWP::Simple::Post - Single-method POST requests

DESCRIPTION
    Really simple wrapper to HTTP POST requests

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::Simple::Post qw(post post_xml);

     my $response = post('http://production/receiver', 'some text');

OVERVIEW
    This module is intended to do for HTTP POST requests what LWP::Simple
    did for GET requests. If you want to do anything complicated, this
    module is not for you. If you just want to push data at a URL with the
    minimum of fuss, you're the target audience.

METHODS
  post
     my $content = post( string $url, string $data );

    Posts the data in $data to the URL in $url, and returns what we got
    back. Returns "undef" on failure.
